<pre> <strong>Theorem:</strong>Every prime number (greater than 2) <em>modulo</em> 4 can be written in the form<em> 4n+1 or 4n+3</em></pre>
<pre> <strong>Proof:</strong>Any number p when divided by 4 leaves remainder 0, 1, 2 or 3. Therefore, the number has the form <em> </pre>
     <pre>4n, 4n+1,4n+2 or 4n+3.</em>Since <em>4n</em> and <em>4n+2</em> are <strong>even</strong>so these can not be a form of a prime number which is an </pre>
     <pre><strong>odd</strong> number(except 2).so these can not be a form of a prime number which is an <strong>odd</strong> number(except 2)</pre>
        <pre>This<em> proves</em> the theorem</pre>
